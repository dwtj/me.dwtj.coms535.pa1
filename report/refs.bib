  abstract={
    A standard technique from the hashing literature is to use two hash
    functions h_1(x) and h_2(x) to simulate additional hash functions of the
    form g_i (x) = h_1(x) + ih_2(x). We demonstrate that this technique can be
    usefully applied to Bloom filters and related data structures.
    Specifically, only two hash functions are necessary to effectively
    implement a Bloom filter without any loss in the asymptotic false positive
    probability. This leads to less computation and potentially less need for
    randomness in practice.
